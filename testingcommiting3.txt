MCP Server + LLM + Client


User -> ( tells to git commit ) -> Client -> passing LLM ( with list of avaialble MCP servers ) -> LLM decides wich MCP to use -> pass infor about MCP to be used to Client -> Client calls it -> Client return output to LLM -> LLM decides what we do next


LLM is actually the two things only here:
1. Proper arguments normalizer/ formater based on MCP Server schema
2. Decision maker on what to do next based on MCP Server OUTPUT
